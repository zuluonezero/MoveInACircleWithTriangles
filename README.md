# MoveInACircleWithTriangles
Unity script to explore how Pythagorean triangles and Polar Co-ordinates make movement in a circle possible in Unity.

Attach this script to any game object and provide a few basic settings like speed and radius and it will circle around.

The maths behind the circular movement is explained and visually represented in the scene view with gizmos.
